Here two wise elders are conducting magic in 2018 at AtwoodFest in Madison, WI. The two would kook at eachother. It seems like a mysterious language to many, but to the wise elders, it is a language conducted under pure intention of a connection with ones higherself. They share ones energy to those around. The magic makers this day, helped ensure 250 people, mixed with one another in laughter and play. With such a powerful movement in ones perception, all the people together helped create a great moment in time. This energy, then was transcended into the clay, and peices were used in many peieces and projects around town.
